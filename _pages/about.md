I'm a junior-year undergraduate student from [School of AI and Automation](https://xxxb.bjut.edu.cn/szdw/jsjs1/rgznyzdhx.htm), [Beijing University of Technology](https://www.bjut.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, artificial intelligence, and sequential recommendation.

 I was advised by [Prof. Jian Yang](https://xxxb.bjut.edu.cn/info/1403/2486.htm) of Pattern Recognition Research Institute from [School of AI and Automation](https://xxxb.bjut.edu.cn/szdw/jsjs1/rgznyzdhx.htm), Beijing University of Technology.

Research Experience                                                                                                                         
A Sequential Recommendation Model Based on Adversarial Masking and Self-attentive Model(until now)
======
⮚	Generated user interests prediction by sequential recommendation model                                                                                
⮚	Iterated the masking model to enlarge similarity distance between training set and masking set                                                                                                       
⮚	Iterated the training model to eliminate similarly distance between recommendation item and original item                                                                                           
⮚	Utilized adversarial masking mechanism to optimize the loss function for training model and masking model simultaneously                                                                                    

Research on Hypertension Early Warning Model Based on Electronic Health Records
======
⮚	Processed large volumes of textual dataset via data mining and word segmentation techniques                                                                                          
⮚	Constructed the testing and training dataset with extracted key information                                                                                                            
⮚	Participated the hypertension early warning model based on Health Electronic Records dataset research                                                                             
⮚	Conducted the analysis, evaluation benchmark and test work on warning model                                                                                 



Hobby & Interest
======
I'm a fitness enthusiast, and I head to the gym at least three days a week to build my muscles.What'more, I am more than glad to discuss political, historical and philosophical content with my friends and would like to get a different perspective from others. And I also love playing computer games like League of Legend, DDraceNetwork and so forth.

Current goals
======
Apply for a master's degree in Canada or the United States.

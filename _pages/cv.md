* B.S. in China, Beijing University of Technology, 2025(expected)

Research experience
======
A Sequential Recommendation Model Based on Adversarial Masking and Self-attention Mechanism      \n
⮚	Generated user interests prediction by sequential recommendation model  \n
⮚	Iterated the masking model to enlarge similarity distance between training set and masking set \n
⮚	Iterated the training model to eliminate similarly distance between recommendation item and original item \n
⮚	Utilized adversarial masking mechanism to optimize the loss function for training model and masking model simultaneously \n

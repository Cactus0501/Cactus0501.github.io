⮚	Generated user interests prediction by sequential recommendation model  <br />
⮚	Iterated the masking model to enlarge similarity distance between training set and masking set <br />
⮚	Iterated the training model to eliminate similarly distance between recommendation item and original item <br />
⮚	Utilized adversarial masking mechanism to optimize the loss function for training model and masking model simultaneously

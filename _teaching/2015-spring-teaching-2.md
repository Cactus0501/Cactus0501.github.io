⮚	Introduced adversarial masks within the embedding layer, creating different augmentation views specifically designed for the SR task  <br />                      
⮚	Integrated an inference module with an occlusion module, which not only refines the mask generation mechanism but also improves the recommendation task to higher levels of accuracy and efficiency <br />                                   
                                                            
⮚	Conducted a comprehensive set of experiments on four public datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines
